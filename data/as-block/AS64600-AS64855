as-block:          AS64600 - AS64855
descr:             dn42 native ASN block (legacy)
remarks:           The legacy policy was that if you own 172.22.x.0/24 you own the ASN 64600+x.
remarks:           With the default allocation policy of an /25 per person now this becomes a problem.
remarks:           Please only make an assignment from this block if you can't use 4 byte ASNs.
